The first step will always be to configure your environment. That is why at the very beginning of learning and development in programming, and later in DS, it is to configure the environment.


# Environment configuration

At the very beginning, it could be helpful to be familiar with PowerShell and Windows CMD

# About IDE's

I use **PyCharm** and **VSC**. For these two **IDE's** it is possible to install **Jupyter** and this is very useful for most Data Science projects.

Additionally, in principle, it seems necessary to have **Anaconda** on your computer so good to know the basic commands and functions of **conda** [tutorial first](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23aQdrS58e0&ab_channel=Academind), [tutorial second](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXrUfNwPOe4&ab_channel=SebastianMantey).


Usually, a Data Science project requires working with several languages and in several environments, so it is worth having a well-configured workplace from the very beginning.

The first step will always be to configure your environment. That is why at the very beginning of learning and development in programming, and later in DS, it is to configure the environment.

# Version control

In software engineering, version control (also known as revision control, source control, or source code management) is a class of systems responsible for managing changes to computer programs, documents, large web sites, or other collections of information. Version control is a component of software configuration management.

In this matter I cannot highlight how important is version control. Main part of day to day GIT flow can be found here. This is my repo with examples and commands.

[link to my repo](https://github.com/Mikma03/Git_GitHub)

There are several tutorial and couses taht links could be find on my repo.

# Debugging

Definition: Debugging is the process of detecting and removing of existing and potential errors (also called as 'bugs') in a software code that can cause it to behave unexpectedly or crash. To prevent incorrect operation of a software or system, debugging is used to find and resolve bugs or defects.


The two tutorials below show how to debug in the IDE developed by Microsoft - VSC

## Tutorials

[Debugging_Link2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cOsxaNC06c&ab_channel=VisualStudioCode)

Debugging is available in virtually every IDE. It's quite fun to use these functions - in the Python aspect - thanks to JetBrains.

# Documenation

Software documentation is written text or illustration that accompanies computer software or is embedded in the source code. The documentation either explains how the software operates or how to use it, and may mean different things to people in different roles.

# Python_Learning

There are repositories on my GitHub that contain Python courses implementation. Mainly my GitHub is devoted to everything related to Data Science and Machine Learning, but basically it is necessary to program at a high level. In my opinion, this is not a Senior Python Developer level, but any code we use should be known to us and understood by us.

As for the Python courses that I have taken and each of these courses has its own repository:

- InfoShare Academy: it is a collection of three courses, each course has a different level of advancement. From the basics to advanced concepts.

- OOP in Python by Packt - this is a course that deeply discusses the issues of object programming

- Books that I have read and highly recommend that are an amazing source of Python knowledge:

    - Bill Lubanovis Book, Ian Ozsvald Book, Michael Walker Book

- JetBrains - Python Core - a very extensive course covering the entire spectrum of work in Python 

## Useful materials

Below are links to books and courses along with a short description of the materials. Thanks to this course and book, you can develop your knowledge in the aspect of programming in Python.


[InfoShare - Python Academy](https://sklep.infoshareacademy.online/produkt/python-academy/)

PythON: Academy is a package of courses as part of the path to Junior Python Developer!


[Track: Python Core](https://hyperskill.org/tracks/2)

Throughout the learning process, you will work on projects that correspond to your interests and your level and acquire new information from theoretical references. Starting from simpler projects like programming a tool for splitting a bill, you will move on to more challenging ones like implementing a web-browser, hacking passwords, or creating your own code analyzer. Having finished this track, you will be able to confidently continue your learning process, for example, by diving into Data Science or focusing on web development with the Django framework.


[Python Object-Oriented Programming](https://subscription.packtpub.com/video/programming/9781801077613/p1/video1_1/course-overview)

The course starts by walking you through the process of setting up a Python development environment. Next, you will get an overview of the versions and history of Python programming and write a simple “Hello World” program to understand the structure of Python code. Moving along, you will get a detailed understanding of Python variables, datatypes, built-in functions, conditional statements, and loops. Next, you will learn how to work with lists, tuples, sets, dictionaries, strings, functions, modules, and packages in Python. Later, you will learn to debug your Python program, work with files, and learn how to handle exceptions. Next, you will learn how to use the numbers and date and time functions in Python programs and study the concepts of package management. Finally, you will learn to create, activate, and deactivate Python virtual environments and get an overview of comprehensions and decorators.

[Introducing Python](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/introducing-python-2nd/9781492051374/)

Easy to understand and fun to read, this updated edition of Introducing Python is ideal for beginning programmers as well as those new to the language. Author Bill Lubanovic takes you from the basics to more involved and varied topics, mixing tutorials with cookbook-style code recipes to explain concepts in Python 3. End-of-chapter exercises help you practice what you’ve learned.

You’ll gain a strong foundation in the language, including best practices for testing, debugging, code reuse, and other development tips. This book also shows you how to use Python for applications in business, science, and the arts, using various Python tools and open source packages.


[Python Data Cleaning Cookbook](https://subscription.packtpub.com/book/data/9781800565661/7/ch07lvl1sec56/using-user-defined-functions-and-apply-with-groupby)

Getting clean data to reveal insights is essential, as directly jumping into data analysis without proper data cleaning may lead to incorrect results. This book shows you tools and techniques that you can apply to clean and handle data with Python. You'll begin by getting familiar with the shape of data by using practices that can be deployed routinely with most data sources. Then, the book teaches you how to manipulate data to get it into a useful form. You'll also learn how to filter and summarize data to gain insights and better understand what makes sense and what does not, along with discovering how to operate on data to address the issues you've identified. Moving on, you'll perform key tasks, such as handling missing values, validating errors, removing duplicate data, monitoring high volumes of data, and handling outliers and invalid dates. Next, you'll cover recipes on using supervised learning and Naive Bayes analysis to identify unexpected values and classification errors, and generate visualizations for exploratory data analysis (EDA) to visualize unexpected values. Finally, you'll build functions and classes that you can reuse without modification when you have new data

## Virtual environment

By default, any Python interpreter that you've installed runs in its own global environment, which is not specific to any one project. For example, if you just run python (Windows) or python3 (macOS/Linux) at a new command prompt, you're running in that interpreter's global environment. Accordingly, any packages that you install or uninstall affect the global environment and all programs that you run within that context.

Although working in the global environment is an easy way to get started, that environment will, over time, become cluttered with many different packages that you've installed for different projects. Such clutter makes it difficult to thoroughly test an application against a specific set of packages with known versions, which is exactly the kind of environment you'd set up on a build server or web server.

For this reason, developers often create a virtual environment for a project. A virtual environment is a subfolder in a project that contains a copy of a specific interpreter. When you activate the virtual environment, any packages you install are installed only in that environment's subfolder. When you then run a Python program within that environment, you know that it's running against only those specific packages. Be aware that if you're not using a virtual environment, and you have multiple versions of Python installed and set in the path environment variable, you might need to specify the Python interpreter to use in the terminal for installing packages to the global environment.

## Dependency management

When installing libraries from external sources, it is worth reading the documentation of a given library first to find out what additional libraries will be downloaded in the package.
Additionally, when creating our own solution, it is worth taking care of the "requirements" file so that another programmer knows what libraries are needed to run our application.

## pipenv - configuration

## CI / CD

Continuous integration (CI) is the practice of automating the integration of code changes from multiple contributors into a single software project. It’s a primary DevOps best practice, allowing developers to frequently merge code changes into a central repository where builds and tests then run.

[More info about CI](https://www.atlassian.com/continuous-delivery/continuous-integration)

Continuous delivery is a software development practice where code changes are automatically prepared for a release to production. A pillar of modern application development, continuous delivery expands upon continuous integration by deploying all code changes to a testing environment and/or a production environment after the build stage. When properly implemented, developers will always have a deployment-ready build artifact that has passed through a standardized test process. 

Continuous delivery lets developers automate testing beyond just unit tests so they can verify application updates across multiple dimensions before deploying to customers. These tests may include UI testing, load testing, integration testing, API reliability testing, etc. This helps developers more thoroughly validate updates and pre-emptively discover issues. With the cloud, it is easy and cost-effective to automate the creation and replication of multiple environments for testing, which was previously difficult to do on-premises.

[More info about CD](https://aws.amazon.com/devops/continuous-delivery/)

## Built-in Exceptions

In Python, all exceptions must be instances of a class that derives from BaseException. In a try statement with an except clause that mentions a particular class, that clause also handles any exception classes derived from that class (but not exception classes from which it is derived). Two exception classes that are not related via subclassing are never equivalent, even if they have the same name.

The built-in exceptions listed below can be generated by the interpreter or built-in functions. Except where mentioned, they have an “associated value” indicating the detailed cause of the error. This may be a string or a tuple of several items of information (e.g., an error code and a string explaining the code). The associated value is usually passed as arguments to the exception class’s constructor.

User code can raise built-in exceptions. This can be used to test an exception handler or to report an error condition “just like” the situation in which the interpreter raises the same exception; but beware that there is nothing to prevent user code from raising an inappropriate error.
