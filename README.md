The first steps will always be to configure your environment. That is why at the very beginning of learning and development in programming, and later in DS, it is to configure the environment.


# Environment configuration

At the very beginning it could be helpfull to be familiar with PowerShell and Windows CMD

**Depending on the IDE**

### 1.1. VSC

1. If you wanted to update you will type conda update python.
2. To update anaconda type conda update conda.
3. If you want to upgrade between major python version like 3.5 to 3.6, you'll have to do conda install python=$pythonversion$

# Summary

I myself use **PyCharm** and **VSC**. For these two **IDE's** it is possible to install **Jupyter** and this is very usefull for most DS project.

Additionally, in principle it seems necessary to have **Anaconda** on your computer so good to know basic comands and functions od **conda** [tutorial first](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23aQdrS58e0&ab_channel=Academind), [tutorial second](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXrUfNwPOe4&ab_channel=SebastianMantey).

Usually, a DS project requires working with several languages and in several environments, so it is worth having a well-configured workplace from the very beginning.
The first steps will always be to configure your environment. That is why at the very beginning of learning and development in programming, and later in DS, it is to configure the environment.


# Usefull shortcuts

## VSC

Command "cls" - clears the terminal in VSC

ctrl + shift + p - opens a command prompt

ctrl + `- opens a terminal

python -m venv venv - creating a virtual environment

ctrl + alt + n - runs python code


## Pycharm

ctrl + D - duplicate the last line

ctrl + alt + L - formats the code

shift + shift - opens

ctrl + shift + F - search

ctrl + shift + E

shift + F6 - rename file

Ctrl+Shift+R - replace in path



## Jupyter

esc + m - z kodu przechodzi do markdown

# Version control

In this matter I cannot highlight how important is version control. Main part of day to day GIT flow can be found here. This is my repo with examples and commands.

There are several tutorial and couses taht links could be find on my repo.
