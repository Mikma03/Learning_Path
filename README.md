The first steps will always be to configure your environment. That is why at the very beginning of learning and development in programming, and later in DS, it is to configure the environment.


## Environment configuration

**Depending on the IDE we work with:**

### 1.1. VSC

  >For VSC configuration, I recommend that you watch this guide, the interpreter is discussed in detail.

### 1.2. Jupyter Notebook

  >For Jupyter I strongly recommend go through this tutorial.

  >And great examples and topics of using Jupyter.

### PyCharm

I myself use *PyCharm* and **VSC**. For these two **IDEs** it is possible to install **Jupyter**.

Additionally, in principle it seems necessary to have **Anaconda** on your computer.

Usually, a DS project requires working with several languages and in several environments, so it is worth having a well-configured workplace from the very beginning.
